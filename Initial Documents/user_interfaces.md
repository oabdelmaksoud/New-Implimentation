# User Interfaces Design: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design for the User Interfaces (UIs) of the Agentic System. It covers the primary UIs: the User Dashboard and the Admin Portal. The design aims to provide intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces for interacting with and managing the system.

### 1.2 Scope
- **User Dashboard:** For end-users to manage tasks, monitor agent activities, view results, and interact with specific agent functionalities.
- **Admin Portal:** For system administrators to configure the system, manage users and roles, oversee agent deployments, manage MCP servers, and monitor overall system health.
- Key UI components, navigation, layout principles, and accessibility considerations.

### 1.3 Design Goals
- **User-Centricity:** Prioritize ease of use, clarity, and efficiency for target user groups.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction patterns across both UIs.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure UIs are usable across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet).
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
- **Information Density:** Provide relevant information without overwhelming the user.
- **Actionability:** Enable users to perform necessary actions quickly and easily.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear feedback for user actions and system status changes.

### 1.4 Target Users
- **User Dashboard Users:**
    - Task Assignors/Managers
    - Data Analysts interacting with agent results
    - Business users leveraging agent capabilities
- **Admin Portal Users:**
    - System Administrators
    - Operations Team
    - Security Administrators
    - Lead Agent Developers (for agent type registration/management)

### 1.5 References
- `Requirements/detailed_requirements.md` (especially REQ-UI sections)
- `Architecture/system_architecture.md`
- `Requirements/technical_stack.md` (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS/Material-UI)
- `Initial Documents/prototypes.md` (will contain visual mockups/wireframes)

## 2. General UI Principles

### 2.1 Layout and Navigation
- **Common Structure:** Both UIs will share a common layout structure:
    - **Top Navigation Bar:** System logo, global search, user profile/logout, notifications.
    - **Left Sidebar Navigation:** Primary navigation links for different sections/modules. Collapsible to save space.
    - **Main Content Area:** Displays the content for the selected section.
- **Breadcrumbs:** Used in the main content area to show the user's current location within the UI hierarchy.
- **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):** Buttons and links will be clearly labeled and visually distinct.

### 2.2 Visual Design
- **Theme:** A clean, modern, and professional theme. Colors and typography will be chosen for readability and to minimize eye strain. (Specific color palette and typography to be defined in a style guide, potentially linked from `prototypes.md`).
- **Iconography:** Consistent and intuitive icons will be used to represent actions and entities.
- **Data Display:**
    - Tables: For structured data, with features like sorting, filtering, pagination.
    - Cards: For displaying summarized information about entities (e.g., agents, tasks).
    - Charts/Graphs: For visualizing analytics and metrics (using a library like Chart.js, Recharts, or Nivo).

### 2.3 Interaction Design
- **Forms:** Clear labels, input validation (client-side and server-side), helpful error messages, and progress indicators for submission.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    - Toasts/Snackbars: For non-critical notifications and success messages.
    - Modals/Dialogs: For critical confirmations, warnings, or focused tasks.
    - Loading Indicators: Spinners or progress bars for asynchronous operations.
- **Search and Filtering:** Robust search and filtering capabilities for lists and tables.

### 2.4 Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Semantic HTML.
- Keyboard navigability for all interactive elements.
- Sufficient color contrast.
- ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Alternative text for images.
- Focus management.

## 5. Wireframes and Mockups
- Detailed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for key screens will be developed as part of the `prototypes.md` document or in a dedicated design tool (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD). These visual designs will provide a concrete representation of the UI layouts and components described here.

## 6. Technology Choices
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach, potentially augmented by a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design for pre-built components and consistency.
- **Charting Library:** Recharts, Nivo, or Chart.js.
- **API Communication:** Axios or Fetch API for RESTful communication with the API Gateway. gRPC-web might be considered if UIs need to communicate directly with gRPC services (though typically via a gateway).

This UI design document provides a blueprint for developing the user-facing aspects of the Agentic System. It will be iterated upon based on feedback from prototyping and user testing.
