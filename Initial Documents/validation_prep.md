# Validation Preparation: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the plan and materials required for the validation of the Agentic System's design and early prototypes. The goal of the validation phase is to gather feedback from stakeholders and potential users to ensure the system aligns with requirements and expectations before proceeding with full-scale development.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan covers the preparation of:
- Validation goals and objectives.
- Identification of target validation participants.
- Validation session agendas and scripts.
- Presentation materials (summarizing requirements, architecture, and UI designs).
- Prototype access and usage instructions.
- Feedback collection mechanisms (questionnaires, interview guides).
- Scheduling and logistics for validation sessions.

### 1.3 Validation Objectives
- Confirm that the documented requirements (`Requirements/detailed_requirements.md`) accurately reflect stakeholder needs.
- Validate the proposed system architecture (`Architecture/system_architecture.md`) for feasibility, scalability, and robustness.
- Assess the usability and intuitiveness of the UI designs (`Initial Documents/user_interfaces.md`) and prototypes (`Initial Documents/prototypes.md`).
- Identify any gaps, misunderstandings, or areas for improvement in the current design.
- Gain stakeholder buy-in and confidence before intensive development begins.

## 2. Target Validation Participants

A diverse group of participants will be invited to ensure comprehensive feedback:

- **Project Sponsors/Key Stakeholders:** To validate overall alignment with business goals.
    - (List specific names/roles from `Initial Documents/team_roster.md` if available, e.g., CEO, Head of Product)
- **Potential End-Users of the User Dashboard:**
    - Task Managers / Team Leads
    - Data Analysts
    - Representatives from business units expected to use agent outputs.
- **Potential Administrators of the Admin Portal:**
    - System Administrators / IT Operations personnel
    - Security Team representatives
    - Lead Developers who might manage agent types.
- **Development Team Members:** To ensure understanding and identify technical feasibility concerns.
- **External Subject Matter Experts (Optional):** If specialized domain knowledge validation is required.

## 3. Validation Materials to Prepare

### 3.1 Presentation Deck
- **Content:**
    - Project overview, goals, and objectives.
    - Summary of key requirements (functional and non-functional).
    - High-level system architecture overview (key diagrams from `Architecture/system_architecture.md`).
    - Overview of the Agent Framework and Integration Layer.
    - Walkthrough of UI designs (key screens from `Initial Documents/user_interfaces.md`).
    - Demonstration of interactive prototypes (links from `Initial Documents/prototypes.md`).
    - Specific questions or areas where feedback is particularly sought.
- **Format:** PowerPoint, Google Slides, or similar.
- **Responsibility:** Product Owner / Lead Architect.

### 3.2 Prototype Access and Guidance
- **Interactive UI Prototypes (Figma/other):**
    - Ensure prototypes are accessible via shareable links.
    - Provide clear instructions on how to navigate the prototypes.
    - Define specific user scenarios or tasks for participants to attempt within the prototypes.
- **Code Prototypes (PoCs):**
    - If applicable for technical validation, provide access to code repositories (e.g., GitHub).
    - Include clear README files with setup and execution instructions.
    - Define expected outcomes and points for technical feedback.
- **Responsibility:** Design Lead / Development Lead.

### 3.3 Feedback Collection Instruments
- **General Feedback Questionnaire:**
    - Likert scale questions on clarity, usability, completeness of designs/requirements.
    - Open-ended questions for qualitative feedback, suggestions, and concerns.
    - Sections for feedback on requirements, architecture, UI, and prototypes.
    - Tool: Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, or a simple document.
- **Usability Testing Script (for UI Prototypes):**
    - A set of predefined tasks for participants to perform using the interactive prototypes.
    - Observer checklist to note task completion, time taken, errors, and qualitative observations.
    - Post-task interview questions.
- **Interview Guide (for stakeholder discussions):**
    - Structured questions to guide discussions on strategic alignment, feasibility, and potential risks.
- **Responsibility:** Product Owner / UX Researcher.

### 3.4 Validation Session Agendas
- A detailed agenda for each type of validation session (e.g., stakeholder review, user usability testing, technical review).
- To be documented in `Initial Documents/validation_agendas.md`.
- **Responsibility:** Project Manager / Product Owner.

### 3.5 Invitation Templates and Scheduling
- Standard email templates for inviting participants.
- Clear communication of session objectives, duration, and required preparation (if any).
- Use a scheduling tool (e.g., Outlook Calendar, Google Calendar, Calendly) to coordinate sessions.
- To be documented in `Initial Documents/validation_invites.md`.
- **Responsibility:** Project Manager.

## 4. Validation Process Overview

1.  **Material Preparation (This Document's Focus):** Create all documents, presentations, and prototype access as outlined above.
2.  **Internal Review:** Conduct an internal review of all validation materials with the core project team.
3.  **Participant Identification & Invitation:** Finalize the list of participants and send out invitations with necessary pre-reading materials (e.g., a summary document).
4.  **Session Scheduling:** Coordinate and confirm session timings.
5.  **Conduct Validation Sessions:**
    - Present designs and prototypes.
    - Facilitate discussions and Q&A.
    - Conduct usability testing sessions.
    - Ensure all participants have an opportunity to provide feedback.
6.  **Collect Feedback:** Administer questionnaires, record interview notes, and gather observations from usability tests.
7.  **Analyze Feedback:** Synthesize all collected feedback to identify common themes, critical issues, and actionable insights.
8.  **Document Findings:** Create a validation summary report.
9.  **Incorporate Feedback:** Update requirements, architecture, UI designs, and other relevant documents based on validated feedback. This leads to the "Finalize Design" step in `todo.md`.

## 5. Timeline for Validation Material Preparation
- **Target Completion Date for all materials:** [Specify a date, e.g., End of Week X, Month 3]
- Individual tasks within material preparation can be assigned and tracked.
