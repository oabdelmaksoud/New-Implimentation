# Integration Layer Document: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the integration layer for the Agentic System. It details the strategies, patterns, and technologies used to enable seamless communication and data exchange between the system's internal components and with external services and tools. The integration layer is crucial for achieving modularity, scalability, and extensibility.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope includes:
- Internal service-to-service communication.
- Agent-to-service communication.
- Agent-to-agent communication.
- Integration with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
- Integration with external systems and APIs.
- Data synchronization and consistency across components.

### 1.3 Goals of the Integration Layer
- To provide reliable and efficient communication channels.
- To abstract underlying communication complexities from components.
- To ensure data integrity and consistency during exchanges.
- To support various communication patterns (synchronous, asynchronous, event-driven).
- To facilitate secure interactions.
- To enable discoverability and interoperability of services and agents.

## 2. Integration Architecture Overview

The integration layer leverages a combination of technologies and patterns as outlined in the System Architecture document:

- **API Gateway:** Single entry point for external client requests (UIs, third-party apps) to backend services.
- **gRPC:** For synchronous, high-performance, low-latency communication between internal microservices (Control Plane).
- **Kafka Message Bus:** For asynchronous, event-driven communication, enabling loose coupling and resilience between services and agents.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Standardized protocol for agents to discover and interact with tools and resources provided by MCP servers.
- **RESTful APIs / SDKs:** For interaction with external systems where gRPC or MCP is not applicable.

## 3. Internal Integration Patterns

### 3.1 Synchronous Communication (gRPC)
- **Usage:** For request/response interactions where immediate feedback is required, primarily for the Control Plane and direct service-to-service calls initiated by the API Gateway or other core services.
- **Technology:** gRPC with Protocol Buffers.
- **Contracts:** Service definitions (.proto files) will define the API contracts, ensuring strong typing and backward/forward compatibility.
- **Key Interactions:**
    - API Gateway to backend services.
    - Control Plane commands to Agent Runtimes.
    - Direct calls between core services for tightly coupled operations.
- **Security:** mTLS will be enforced for all internal gRPC communication.
- **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes DNS-based service discovery will be used for gRPC endpoints.

### 3.2 Asynchronous Communication (Kafka)
- **Usage:** For event-driven interactions, decoupling services, handling long-running processes, and broadcasting state changes.
- **Technology:** Kafka Message Bus.
- **Topics:** Well-defined Kafka topics will be established for different event types (e.g., `task.created`, `agent.status.updated`, `knowledge.updated`).
- **Events:** Standardized event schemas (e.g., JSON, Avro) will be used for messages published to Kafka. Schema registry will be considered for managing Avro schemas.
- **Producers/Consumers:** Services and agents will act as producers and/or consumers for relevant topics. Consumer groups will be used for load balancing and fault tolerance.
- **Key Interactions:**
    - Agent-to-agent communication.
    - Broadcasting system-wide events.
    - Distributing tasks to available agent runtimes.
    - Streaming logs and metrics to monitoring systems.
- **Data Consistency:** Eventual consistency model. Compensating transactions or sagas might be implemented for complex workflows spanning multiple services.

## 4. Agent Integration

### 4.1 Agent Lifecycle and Control
- Agents are managed by the Agent Core Framework and run within Agent Runtimes.
- Control Plane (gRPC) is used for direct commands to agents (e.g., start, stop, update configuration).

### 4.2 Agent Communication
- **Intra-Agent Communication (within a multi-agent system):** Primarily via Kafka for asynchronous messaging.
- **Agent-Service Communication:**
    - For control/coordination: gRPC via Control Plane.
    - For data/events: Kafka.
    - For accessing core functionalities (e.g., knowledge base): gRPC/HTTP via API Gateway or direct gRPC to services.

### 4.3 Agent Tool Usage (MCP Integration)
- **Discovery:** Agents will query the MCP Server Registry & Discovery Service to find available tools and their schemas.
- **Invocation:** Agents will use a standardized MCP client library to make calls to MCP servers. This library will handle the underlying protocol (e.g., HTTP, gRPC) for interacting with the specific MCP server.
- **MCP Adapter/Proxy:** An optional component that can sit between Agent Runtimes and MCP Servers to provide a unified interface, handle authentication, or perform request/response transformations if MCP servers have diverse native protocols.
- **Security:** MCP calls will be secured using API keys or OAuth tokens managed by Vault and passed securely to agents.

## 5. External System Integration

### 5.1 Integration via MCP Servers
- This is the preferred method for agents to interact with external systems.
- MCP servers encapsulate the logic for communicating with specific external APIs (e.g., GitHub API, database connectors, cloud service SDKs).
- Benefits: Centralized management of external API credentials, abstraction of external API complexities, standardized tool interface for agents.

### 5.2 Direct API Integration (Non-MCP)
- For core services that need to interact with external systems directly (not through an agent's tool).
- **Technology:** RESTful APIs, SOAP, or vendor-specific SDKs.
- **Security:** Credentials for direct integrations will be stored in Vault and accessed by the respective services.
- **Resilience:** Circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and timeouts will be implemented for external calls.
- **Examples:**
    - Monitoring service sending alerts to PagerDuty.
    - User authentication service integrating with an external Identity Provider (IdP).

## 6. Data Integration and Synchronization

### 6.1 Data Consistency
- **Strong Consistency:** Required for critical operations like financial transactions or user authentication. Achieved through RDBMS transactions or two-phase commits where necessary (though the latter is complex and avoided if possible).
- **Eventual Consistency:** Acceptable for many parts of the system, especially those relying on asynchronous event propagation via Kafka (e.g., updating read models, search indexes).
- **Caching:** Redis will be used for caching to improve performance and reduce load on backend datastores. Cache invalidation strategies (e.g., TTL, write-through, write-behind, event-based) will be implemented.

### 6.2 Data Transformation
- Data transformation may be needed when integrating systems with different data models.
- This can occur within services, agents, or dedicated transformation components (e.g., an ETL-like process if batch synchronization is needed, or within an API gateway/adapter layer).

## 7. API Design and Management

### 7.1 API Gateway
- All external-facing APIs (for UIs and third-party apps) will be exposed through an API Gateway.
- Responsibilities:
    - Request routing and load balancing.
    - Authentication and authorization (e.g., validating JWTs, checking API keys).
    - Rate limiting and throttling.
    - Request/response transformation (if needed).
    - API versioning.
    - Caching common responses.
- **Technology:** Kong, Tyk, AWS API Gateway, Apigee, or similar.

### 7.2 Internal APIs (gRPC)
- Defined using Protocol Buffers.
- Versioning will be handled using .proto package names or service versioning.
- Focus on performance and strong typing.

### 7.3 API Documentation
- OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) for RESTful APIs exposed via the API Gateway.
- Protocol Buffer definitions serve as documentation for gRPC services.
- Documentation should be auto-generated where possible and kept up-to-date.

## 8. Security Considerations in Integration
- **Authentication:** Secure all integration points. mTLS for internal gRPC, JWT/OAuth for API Gateway, API keys for MCP servers/external APIs.
- **Authorization:** Enforce RBAC and principle of least privilege for all interactions.
- **Data Encryption:** TLS for all data in transit. Encryption for sensitive data at rest.
- **Secret Management:** Use Vault for all API keys, credentials, and certificates.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all data received from external sources or other services.
- **Audit Trails:** Log all significant integration events for security monitoring and forensics.

## 9. Monitoring and Management of Integrations
- **Health Checks:** All integration points and services should expose health check endpoints.
- **Metrics:** Collect metrics on API call latency, error rates, throughput for all integrations.
- **Logging:** Centralized logging for all integration activities.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for integration failures, high error rates, or performance degradation.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to track requests across multiple services and integration points.

This integration layer design aims to create a connected, robust, and flexible Agentic System, capable of evolving and incorporating new functionalities and external services efficiently.
