## 3. Core Agent Abstractions

### 3.1 Base Agent Class (Agent SDK)
- **Purpose:** Provides a foundational class or Software Development Kit (SDK) that all specialized agents will inherit from or utilize.
- **Language:** Primarily Python, with potential for Node.js SDK if specific agent types require it.
- **Core Functionalities Provided:**
    - **Initialization:** Handling agent configuration, connecting to message bus and state store.
    - **Lifecycle Hooks:** Standard methods for agent startup, shutdown, pausing, and resuming (e.g., `on_start()`, `on_stop()`, `on_message()`, `on_task_assigned()`).
    - **Communication Primitives:** Simplified methods for publishing and subscribing to Kafka topics, and making gRPC calls to the Control Plane or other core services.
    - **State Management:** Helpers for interacting with Redis to persist and retrieve operational agent state.
    - **Task Handling:** Integration with the Task Management Service for receiving, processing, and updating tasks.
    - **Knowledge Access:** Utilities for querying the Knowledge Management Service.
    - **MCP Tool Interaction:** Integration with the `MCPClient` for discovering and using tools.
    - **Logging:** Standardized logging interface.
    - **Error Handling:** Built-in error reporting and basic resilience patterns (e.g., retries for transient errors).
- **Example (Conceptual Python):**
  ```python
  from agent_sdk import BaseAgent, skill, capability

  class MySpecializedAgent(BaseAgent):
      def __init__(self, agent_id, config):
          super().__init__(agent_id, config)
          self.some_state = None

      async def on_start(self):
          self.logger.info(f"Agent {self.agent_id} started.")
          self.some_state = await self.state_manager.get("my_key")
          await self.subscribe_to_topic("relevant_events_topic", self.handle_event)

      async def handle_event(self, message):
          self.logger.info(f"Received event: {message}")
          # Process event and potentially update state or publish new events
          await self.state_manager.set("my_key", "new_value")
          await self.publish_to_topic("processed_events_topic", {"result": "done"})

      @skill(name="process_document", description="Processes a given document.")
      async def process_document_skill(self, document_url, processing_parameters):
          # Use MCP client to fetch document
          doc_content = await self.mcp.tools.document_fetcher.fetch(url=document_url)
          # Perform processing
          result = f"Processed: {doc_content[:50]}..."
          return result

      # ... other skills and capabilities
  ```

### 3.2 Skills
- **Purpose:** Represent specific, fine-grained actions or functionalities an agent can perform. Skills are typically stateless or rely on the agent's internal state.
- **Implementation:** Implemented as methods within an agent class, often decorated to make them discoverable or invokable.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Well-defined inputs and outputs.
    - Can be composed to form more complex capabilities.
    - Examples: `fetch_webpage_content`, `summarize_text`, `analyze_image_sentiment`, `query_database_record`.

### 3.3 Capabilities
- **Purpose:** Represent broader, more complex functionalities or roles an agent possesses. Capabilities are often composed of multiple skills and may involve more complex state management or interaction patterns.
- **Implementation:** Can be represented by a collection of related skills, specific configurations, or dedicated modules within an agent.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Define what an agent *can do* at a higher level.
    - May involve a sequence of skill executions or complex decision-making logic.
    - Examples: `WebResearchCapability`, `CodeGenerationCapability`, `DataAnalysisCapability`.
- **Capability Manager:** A component (potentially part of the Base Agent or Agent Core Service) that allows agents to declare their capabilities and helps in matching tasks to agents with the required capabilities.

### 3.4 Agent Configuration
- **Purpose:** Define the specific parameters, settings, and resource allocations for an agent instance.
- **Format:** YAML or JSON.
- **Content:**
    - Agent ID, Agent Type/Class.
    - Kafka topics to subscribe/publish to.
    - Redis connection details (or abstracted access).
    - Default skill parameters.
    - Resource limits (CPU, memory - managed by Agent Runtime).
    - Credentials or references to secrets in Vault for accessing MCP tools or other services.
- **Agent Configuration Manager:** A component responsible for loading, validating, and providing configuration to agent instances. Configurations can be stored centrally and fetched by Agent Runtimes.

## 4. Agent Lifecycle Management

- **Managed by:** Agent Core Service in conjunction with Agent Runtimes.
- **States:** `DEFINED`, `STARTING`, `RUNNING`, `PAUSED`, `STOPPING`, `STOPPED`, `FAILED`.
- **Process:**
    1.  **Definition:** Agent type, capabilities, and default configuration are defined and registered with the Agent Core Service.
    2.  **Instantiation/Deployment:** Agent Core Service instructs an Agent Runtime to create an instance of an agent. The Agent Runtime provisions resources (e.g., a container).
    3.  **Initialization:** The agent instance loads its configuration, connects to Kafka/Redis, and performs setup (via `on_start()`).
    4.  **Running:** Agent actively processes tasks, events, and interacts with the system.
    5.  **Control Operations (via Control Plane):**
        -   `Pause`: Temporarily suspend task processing.
        -   `Resume`: Resume task processing.
        -   `Stop`: Gracefully shut down the agent (via `on_stop()`), releasing resources.
        -   `Update Configuration`: Apply new configuration settings (may require restart).
    6.  **Failure Handling:** If an agent crashes, the Agent Runtime attempts to restart it based on a defined policy. Persistent failures are reported to the Agent Core Service and logged.

## 5. Agent Communication (Covered in Integration Layer)
- Primarily Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication.
- gRPC for synchronous control/coordination via Control Plane.
- Refer to `Initial Documents/integration_layer.md` for details.

## 6. Agent State Management

- **Operational State:** Short-lived, frequently changing state specific to an agent's current operations (e.g., current task progress, intermediate calculations, session data).
    - **Storage:** Redis.
    - **Access:** Via helper methods in the Base Agent SDK.
    - **Considerations:** Data serialization (e.g., JSON, Pickle - though Pickle has security implications if data is untrusted).
- **Persistent State/Knowledge:** Longer-term data or knowledge an agent might accumulate or need to persist beyond its immediate operational cycle.
    - **Storage:** Could be PostgreSQL (if structured), Object Storage (if large/binary), or managed by the Knowledge Management Service.
    - **Access:** Through dedicated service calls or SDK methods.

## 7. Agent Interaction with MCP Servers

- **MCP Client Library:** A component within the Base Agent SDK (or a standalone library) that agents use to interact with MCP servers.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Discovery:** Connects to the MCP Server Registry to find available MCP servers and their tools/schemas.
    - **Invocation:** Handles the protocol-level details of calling MCP tools (e.g., constructing HTTP requests, gRPC calls).
    - **Authentication:** Manages credentials (fetched from Vault via Agent Configuration) for authenticating to MCP servers.
    - **Error Handling:** Handles common errors from MCP tool calls.
- **Example Usage (Conceptual):**
  ```python
  # Within an agent skill
  async def some_skill(self, query):
      # Discover and use a search tool
      search_results = await self.mcp.tools.web_search_tool.search(query=query, max_results=5)
      return search_results
  ```

## 8. Error Handling and Resilience in Agents

- **Within Agent Logic:** Agents should implement try-except blocks for operations that can fail (e.g., external API calls, data processing).
- **Base Agent SDK Support:**
    - Automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient network errors when communicating with core services or MCP servers.
    - Standardized error reporting to the logging system and potentially to the Task Management Service (e.g., marking a task as failed with an error reason).
- **Agent Runtime Responsibility:**
    - Monitoring agent health (heartbeats).
    - Restarting failed agent instances according to policy.
- **"Poison Pill" Handling:** Mechanisms to deal with messages or tasks that consistently cause an agent to fail (e.g., moving them to a dead-letter queue after several failed attempts).

## 9. Agent Development and Registration Workflow

1.  **Develop Agent:** Create a new agent class inheriting from `BaseAgent` (Python) or using the equivalent SDK. Implement skills and capabilities.
2.  **Define Configuration:** Create a default configuration file (YAML/JSON) for the new agent type.
3.  **Package Agent:** Package the agent code and its dependencies (e.g., into a Docker image).
4.  **Register Agent Type:** Register the new agent type with the Agent Core Service, providing its Docker image location, default configuration template, and declared capabilities.
5.  **Deploy/Instantiate:** Administrators or other agents can then request instances of this agent type to be deployed and run.

This framework aims to provide a robust and flexible foundation for building a diverse ecosystem of intelligent agents capable of complex collaboration and task execution.
