# Prototypes Design: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the plan for developing prototypes for the Agentic System. Prototyping is a crucial step to validate design concepts, gather user feedback early, and refine the user experience before full-scale development. This document will describe the scope, objectives, and types of prototypes to be created for key system UIs and agent interactions.

### 1.2 Scope
Prototyping efforts will focus on:
- **User Dashboard:** Key screens for task management and agent activity monitoring.
- **Admin Portal:** Core sections for system configuration and agent management.
- **Agent Interaction Patterns:** Simulating how users might interact with specific agent capabilities or how agents might collaborate on a task (conceptual, may not be a UI prototype).
- **MCP Tool Interaction:** Demonstrating how an agent might discover and use an MCP tool.

### 1.3 Objectives of Prototyping
- Validate the usability and intuitiveness of the UI designs.
- Test key user workflows and identify potential pain points.
- Gather early feedback from stakeholders and target users.
- Clarify requirements and design assumptions.
- Reduce development risks by identifying issues early.
- Serve as a visual guide for the development team.

### 1.4 Prototype Types
- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes (Wireframes):** Basic sketches or digital wireframes focusing on layout, structure, and information hierarchy. Used for initial concept validation.
    - Tools: Balsamiq, Whimsical, or even hand sketches.
- **Medium-Fidelity Prototypes (Mockups):** Static visual representations of the UI with more detail on visual design elements (colors, typography, iconography) but limited interactivity.
    - Tools: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD.
- **High-Fidelity Prototypes (Interactive Mockups/Clickable Prototypes):** Visually polished mockups with simulated interactivity, allowing users to click through workflows.
    - Tools: Figma, Sketch with InVision/Marvel, Adobe XD, Axure RP.
- **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Prototypes:** Small, functional pieces of code to test specific technical assumptions or complex interactions (e.g., a basic agent using an MCP tool).

## 2. User Dashboard Prototypes

### 2.1 Task List and Creation (High-Fidelity)
- **Objective:** Validate the workflow for viewing, filtering, sorting tasks, and creating a new task.
- **Key Screens/States:**
    - Default task list view.
    - Task list with filters applied (status, priority).
    - Task list sorted by a specific column.
    - "Create New Task" modal/form.
    - Form validation states (e.g., errors, success).
    - Confirmation of task creation.
- **Interactions to Simulate:**
    - Clicking filter options.
    - Clicking sortable column headers.
    - Opening the "Create New Task" form.
    - Filling out and submitting the form.
    - Navigating to a task detail view from the list.
- **Visuals:** To be developed in Figma (link to Figma project/frames will be added here).

### 2.2 Task Detail View (Medium-to-High-Fidelity)
- **Objective:** Validate the display of comprehensive task information and available actions.
- **Key Screens/States:**
    - View of task details (description, parameters, status, logs).
    - Display of assigned agent(s).
    - Commenting section.
    - Action buttons (edit, cancel, reassign - based on permissions).
- **Interactions to Simulate:**
    - Expanding/collapsing log sections.
    - Simulating adding a comment.
- **Visuals:** To be developed in Figma.

### 2.3 Agent Activity Snippet (Low-Fidelity Wireframe initially, then Medium)
- **Objective:** Validate how users can get a quick overview of relevant agent activity.
- **Key Screens/States:**
    - A section on the main dashboard or a dedicated "My Agents" page.
    - Card view for each relevant agent showing ID, type, current task, status.

## 3. Admin Portal Prototypes

### 3.1 Agent Instance Management (High-Fidelity)
- **Objective:** Validate the workflow for viewing, monitoring, and controlling agent instances.
- **Key Screens/States:**
    - List of agent instances with status, type, resource usage.
    - Filtering/sorting agent instances.
    - Agent instance detail view (logs, configuration, actions).
    - Modal/form for deploying a new agent instance.
    - Confirmation for actions like stop/start/terminate.
- **Interactions to Simulate:**
    - Starting/stopping an agent instance.
    - Viewing logs for an instance.
    - Deploying a new agent instance from a registered type.
- **Visuals:** To be developed in Figma.

### 3.2 MCP Server Registry (Medium-Fidelity)
- **Objective:** Validate how administrators can view and manage registered MCP servers.
- **Key Screens/States:**
    - List of MCP servers with status and tool count.
    - Detail view for an MCP server showing its configuration and available tools.
    - Form for registering a new MCP server.
- **Visuals:** To be developed in Figma.

    - Role list with actions (edit permissions).
    - User creation/edit form.
    - Role creation/edit form with permission selection.

## 4. Agent Interaction & MCP Prototypes (Conceptual / PoC)

### 4.1 Basic Agent Task Processing PoC (Code Prototype)
- **Objective:** Demonstrate a simple agent (Python SDK) receiving a task via Kafka, processing it (e.g., a string manipulation), and reporting status back.
- **Scope:**
    - Minimal agent implementation.
    - Basic Kafka producer/consumer setup.
    - Simple task definition.
- **Deliverable:** Small Python script(s) and documentation of setup/execution.

### 4.2 Agent using an MCP Tool PoC (Code Prototype)
- **Objective:** Demonstrate an agent discovering and using a simple tool from a mock MCP server.
- **Scope:**
    - Minimal agent implementation.
    - Mock MCP server (e.g., a simple FastAPI/Express.js app exposing one tool).
    - Agent uses MCP Client library to find and call the tool.
- **Deliverable:** Python scripts for the agent and mock MCP server, documentation.

## 5. Prototyping Tools and Technologies
- **Wireframing:** Balsamiq, Whimsical, or similar.
- **Mockups & Interactive Prototypes:** Figma (preferred), Sketch, Adobe XD.
- **Code Prototypes (PoCs):** Python (FastAPI for mock servers), Node.js (Express.js for mock servers).

## 6. Feedback and Iteration Plan
- Prototypes will be shared with stakeholders (product owners, key users, development team) at various stages.
- Feedback sessions will be organized (e.g., walkthroughs, usability testing for high-fidelity prototypes).
- Feedback will be documented and used to iterate on the designs and prototypes.
- Multiple iterations are expected for UI prototypes.

## 7. Prototype Deliverables (Summary)
- Links to Figma (or other design tool) projects for UI wireframes and mockups (to be filled in as created).
- Small, documented code projects for PoC prototypes (links to be filled in).
- This document will serve as a central tracker for prototype scope and status.

**Note:** This document primarily outlines the *plan* for prototypes. The actual visual designs and code PoCs will reside in their respective tools/repositories, and this document will be updated with links to them.
