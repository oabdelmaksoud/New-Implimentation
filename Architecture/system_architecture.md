# System Architecture Document: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the architecture of the Agentic System. It outlines the major components, their interactions, and the overall design principles guiding the system's construction. This architecture aims to meet the functional and non-functional requirements detailed in the `Requirements/detailed_requirements.md` document.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this architectural design encompasses all core modules of the Agentic System, including the agent framework, task management, knowledge management, communication infrastructure, data persistence, user interfaces, MCP server integration, and security considerations.

### 1.3 Architectural Goals
- **Modularity:** Components should be loosely coupled and independently deployable.
- **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle increasing numbers of agents, tasks, and users.
- **Extensibility:** New agent types, capabilities, and MCP tools should be easily integrated.
- **Resilience:** The system should be fault-tolerant, with mechanisms for recovery and high availability.
- **Security:** Security principles must be embedded throughout the architecture.
- **Maintainability:** The design should promote ease of understanding, debugging, and modification.

### 1.4 Key Design Principles
- **Microservices Architecture:** Core functionalities will be implemented as independent microservices.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous communication via a message bus (Kafka) will be a primary interaction pattern.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between different system responsibilities.
- **Stateless Services:** Services should be stateless where possible to facilitate scaling and resilience.
- **API-First Design:** Interactions between components will be defined by clear API contracts (gRPC, REST).

## 3. Component Descriptions

### 3.1 User Interfaces
- **Dashboard UI (React):** Provides system overview, task management, agent monitoring, and analytics for end-users. Communicates with backend services via the API Gateway.
- **Admin UI (React):** Allows administrators to configure system parameters, manage agents, MCP servers, users, and roles. Communicates with backend services via the API Gateway.

### 3.2 API Gateway / Load Balancer
- Serves as the single entry point for all client requests (UI, external API consumers).
- Handles request routing, load balancing, SSL termination, and potentially authentication/authorization offloading.
- Technologies: Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native solutions (e.g., AWS ALB/API Gateway, GCP Cloud Load Balancing).

### 3.3 Core Services (Microservices)
- **Agent Core Framework Service:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of agents (registration, instantiation, termination).
    - Provides foundational services for agents (e.g., identity, configuration access).
    - Coordinates high-level agent interactions.
- **Task Management Service:**
    - Manages the lifecycle of tasks (creation, queuing, assignment, tracking, completion).
    - Implements the work queue, priority scheduler, and dependency resolver.
    - Exposes APIs for task manipulation and querying.
- **Knowledge Management Service:**
    - Manages the storage, indexing, and retrieval of knowledge.
    - Provides APIs for agents and users to query and update the knowledge base.
    - Supports various knowledge representations and semantic search.
- **MCP Server Registry & Discovery Service:**
    - Maintains a registry of available MCP servers (both GitHub-based and local).
    - Implements health checks and auto-discovery mechanisms for MCP servers.
    - Provides an API for agents to look up available tools and resources.
- **gRPC Control Plane:**
    - A set of gRPC services providing high-performance, low-latency internal APIs for core system operations.
    - Used for direct communication between critical backend services (e.g., Agent Core to Agent Runtimes for control commands, Task Manager to Agent Runtimes for task assignments).
    - Defined by Protocol Buffer schemas.

### 3.4 Communication Infrastructure
- **Kafka Message Bus:**
    - Primary mechanism for asynchronous, event-driven communication between services and agents.
    - Used for agent-to-agent communication, event notifications, task distribution (potentially), and log streaming.
    - Configured with appropriate topics, partitions, and consumer groups for scalability and resilience.

### 3.5 Data Persistence
- **Redis:**
    - In-memory data store for caching frequently accessed data.
    - Manages agent operational state (short-lived, frequently updated).
    - Potentially used for session management for UIs.
- **PostgreSQL (or similar RDBMS/NoSQL):**
    - Persistent storage for structured data like task metadata, user accounts, roles, and the knowledge base index.
    - Chosen for its reliability, transactional capabilities, and querying flexibility.
- **Object Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage):**
    - Stores large binary objects, unstructured knowledge content (e.g., documents, model files), and system/application logs.
- **HashiCorp Vault:**
    - Centralized secret management for API keys, database credentials, certificates, and other sensitive information.
    - Provides secure storage, access control, and auditing for secrets.

### 3.6 Agent Runtimes
- Dedicated environments (e.g., Docker containers, Kubernetes Pods) where individual agent instances execute.
- Each runtime hosts one or more agents, providing them with necessary resources and isolation.
- Communicates with the Agent Core Framework for lifecycle management and the Control Plane for commands.
- Interacts with Kafka for event-based communication and MCP Servers for tool usage.

### 3.7 MCP Servers
- **GitHub-based MCP Servers:** External MCP servers, typically npm packages or repositories, providing tools that might interact with GitHub APIs or other cloud services.
- **Local MCP Servers (Python/Node.js):** Custom-developed MCP servers running within the system's infrastructure, providing specialized tools or access to internal resources.
- All MCP servers adhere to the Model Context Protocol for tool discovery and invocation.

### 3.8 External Systems
- Third-party services or APIs that agents interact with via MCP servers (e.g., GitHub, external databases, weather APIs).

### 3.9 Monitoring & Logging
- **Monitoring Service (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana):**
    - Collects metrics from all system components (services, agents, infrastructure).
    - Provides dashboards for visualizing system health, performance, and resource utilization.
    - Configured with alerting rules for critical issues.
- **Logging Service (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):**
    - Centralized aggregation, storage, and analysis of logs from all components.
    - Enables searching, filtering, and visualization of log data for debugging and auditing.

## 4. Data Flow Diagrams

### 4.1 Task Creation and Execution Flow
1. User creates a task via Dashboard UI.
2. Dashboard UI sends a request to API Gateway.
3. API Gateway routes request to Task Management Service.
4. Task Management Service validates and stores task metadata in PostgreSQL, places task in Kafka work queue.
5. Agent Core Framework / Control Plane identifies a suitable Agent Runtime.
6. Task is assigned to an agent in an Agent Runtime via Control Plane or by agent polling Kafka.
7. Agent executes the task:
    a. May query Knowledge Management Service (via API Gateway or gRPC).
    b. May interact with MCP Servers (which may call External Systems).
    c. May publish/consume events via Kafka.
    d. Updates its state in Redis.
8. Agent reports task progress/completion to Task Management Service (via Kafka or gRPC).
9. Task Management Service updates task status in PostgreSQL.
10. Dashboard UI reflects updated task status.

### 4.2 Knowledge Query Flow
1. Agent requires information for a task.
2. Agent sends a query to Knowledge Management Service (via gRPC or API Gateway).
3. Knowledge Management Service:
    a. Queries its index in PostgreSQL.
    b. Retrieves relevant content from Object Storage (if applicable).
    c. Returns knowledge to the agent.

## 5. Deployment Architecture
- The system will be deployed on Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Core services, agent runtimes, and local MCP servers will run as Docker containers managed by Kubernetes deployments and services.
- Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Vault will be deployed as stateful sets or utilize managed cloud services (e.g., AWS MSK, ElastiCache, RDS, Secrets Manager).
- A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) will automate building, testing, and deploying components.
- Multiple environments (dev, staging, production) will be maintained.

## 6. Security Architecture
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (with PKCE) for UIs, JWT for service-to-service and API Gateway. API Keys for specific external integrations.
- **Authorization:** RBAC enforced at the API Gateway and within individual services.
- **Data Protection:** TLS 1.3 for data in transit. AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest (managed by Vault where applicable).
- **Secret Management:** HashiCorp Vault for all system secrets.
- **Network Security:** Kubernetes network policies, security groups/firewalls to restrict traffic flow.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorous input validation at API Gateway and service boundaries.
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events.
- **mTLS:** Considered for internal service-to-service communication within the Kubernetes cluster for enhanced security.

## 7. Scalability and Resilience
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Most services (Agent Runtimes, Task Processors, UI backends) are designed to be stateless and can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances.
- **Kafka & Redis:** Scalable by adding more brokers/nodes and partitions.
- **Database:** Scalable through read replicas, sharding (if necessary), or using managed scalable database services.
- **Resilience:**
    - Kubernetes handles pod restarts and rescheduling.
    - Redundant instances for critical services.
    - Kafka provides message durability.
    - Circuit breakers and retries for inter-service communication.

## 8. Technology Choices Rationale
- **React:** Popular, component-based UI library with a large ecosystem.
- **Python/Node.js (for services/agents):** Strong ecosystems, suitable for AI/ML and general backend development.
- **Kafka:** Industry standard for high-throughput, scalable event streaming.
- **Redis:** Fast in-memory store for caching and state management.
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust, feature-rich open-source RDBMS.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Standard for containerization and orchestration, enabling portability and scalability.
- **gRPC & Protocol Buffers:** Efficient, high-performance RPC framework for internal communication.
- **HashiCorp Vault:** Secure and reliable secrets management.
- **Mermaid:** For embedding diagrams directly in Markdown.

## 9. Future Considerations
- **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd):** For advanced traffic management, observability, and security for microservices.
- **Serverless Functions:** For specific, event-driven tasks to optimize resource usage.
- **Edge Computing:** For deploying agents closer to data sources or users in specific scenarios.

This architecture provides a foundation for a robust, scalable, and extensible Agentic System. It will be refined further as development progresses and specific implementation details are addressed.
