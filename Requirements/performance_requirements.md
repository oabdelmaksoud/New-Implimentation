# Performance Requirements: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the performance requirements for the Agentic System. These requirements define the expected responsiveness, throughput, scalability, and resource utilization of the system under various conditions. Meeting these requirements is critical for ensuring a positive user experience and efficient system operation.

### 1.2 Scope
These performance requirements apply to all key components and end-to-end workflows of the Agentic System, including:
- User Interfaces (Dashboard, Admin Portal)
- API Gateway and backend services
- Agent Core Framework and Agent Runtimes
- Task Management System
- Knowledge Management System
- MCP Server interactions
- Data persistence layers (databases, Kafka, Redis)

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Latency:** The time taken to process a single request or operation. Often measured as average, median (p50), 95th percentile (p95), and 99th percentile (p99).
- **Throughput:** The number of requests or operations the system can handle per unit of time (e.g., tasks per second, API requests per minute).
- **Scalability:** The ability of the system to handle increasing load by adding resources (horizontal or vertical scaling).
- **Concurrency:** The number of simultaneous users or operations the system can support.
- **Resource Utilization:** Consumption of system resources like CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and disk I/O.
- **Normal Load:** Expected average load during typical usage periods.
- **Peak Load:** Expected maximum load during busiest usage periods (e.g., end-of-month processing, specific campaign events).
- **Stress Load:** Load exceeding peak load, used to determine system breaking points and stability.

- **REQ-PERF-GEN-001:** The system must remain stable and responsive under sustained normal and peak load conditions.
- **REQ-PERF-GEN-002:** Performance degradation must be graceful when the system approaches its capacity limits, rather than resulting in abrupt failures.
- **REQ-PERF-GEN-003:** Performance metrics must be continuously monitored, and alerts configured for breaches of defined thresholds.
- **REQ-PERF-GEN-004:** The system design must allow for future performance enhancements and scaling without requiring major architectural overhauls.

- **REQ-PERF-TP-002 (Peak Load):** The system must support processing at least 300 concurrent simple tasks, with an aggregate throughput of 25 tasks/second.
*(These are initial baseline figures and will be refined based on specific use cases and agent complexity.)*

### 4.2 API Gateway Throughput
- **REQ-PERF-TP-003 (Normal Load):** The API Gateway must handle at least 500 requests per second (RPS).
- **REQ-PERF-TP-004 (Peak Load):** The API Gateway must handle at least 1500 RPS.

### 4.3 Kafka Message Bus Throughput

### 4.4 Agent Event Processing

## 5. Scalability Requirements

- **REQ-PERF-SCAL-001 (Horizontal Scaling):** Core services (Task Management, Knowledge Management, Agent Runtimes, UI Backends) must be ableto scale horizontally by adding more instances. The system should demonstrate near-linear scalability for these components up to 3x the baseline instance count.

## 8. Stress and Soak Testing Requirements

- **REQ-PERF-STRESS-001:** The system must undergo stress testing to identify its breaking point and ensure it fails gracefully (e.g., returns HTTP 503 Service Unavailable) rather than crashing or corrupting data.
- **REQ-PERF-SOAK-001:** The system must undergo soak testing (endurance testing) by running under sustained peak load for an extended period (e.g., 8-24 hours) to identify issues like memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or performance degradation over time.

## 9. Performance Testing and Benchmarking

- **REQ-PERF-TEST-001:** A comprehensive performance testing strategy must be developed, including load, stress, soak, and scalability tests.
- **REQ-PERF-TEST-002:** Performance tests must be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect regressions early.
- **REQ-PERF-TEST-003:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) must be defined and tracked for each test.
- **REQ-PERF-TEST-004:** Test environments must be representative of the production environment in terms of infrastructure and data volume (where feasible).
- **REQ-PERF-TEST-005:** Performance test results must be documented, analyzed, and used to identify and address bottlenecks.
- **REQ-PERF-TEST-006:** Tools like JMeter, k6, Locust, or similar will be used for load generation. Profiling tools will be used for identifying code-level bottlenecks.

These performance requirements will be validated through rigorous testing before production deployment and monitored continuously during operation. Adjustments may be made based on test results and evolving business needs.
