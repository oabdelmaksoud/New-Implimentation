# Security Requirements: Agentic System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the comprehensive security requirements for the Agentic System. It aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the system, its data, and its interactions. These requirements will guide the design, development, deployment, and operation of the system.

### 1.2 Scope
These security requirements apply to all components of the Agentic System, including:
- Agent Core Framework and Agent Runtimes
- Task Management System
- Knowledge Management System
- User Interfaces (Dashboard, Admin Portal)
- MCP Server Infrastructure and individual MCP Servers
- Communication channels (internal and external)
- Data storage and processing
- Integration points with external systems
- Underlying infrastructure (cloud, Kubernetes)

### 1.3 Guiding Principles
- **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and components.
- **Secure by Design & Default:** Integrate security into the entire development lifecycle and configure secure defaults.
- **Zero Trust Architecture Concepts:** Assume no implicit trust; verify explicitly.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and retain only necessary data.
- **Regular Audits and Updates:** Continuously assess and improve security posture.

## 2. Authentication Requirements

### 2.1 User Authentication
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-001:** All user access to UIs (Dashboard, Admin Portal) must be authenticated.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-002:** The system must support strong password policies (e.g., complexity, length, history, lockout after failed attempts).
    - Minimum 12 characters.
    - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
    - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-003:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be supported and enforced for all administrative accounts and optionally for regular user accounts.
    - Supported factors: TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy), FIDO2/WebAuthn.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-004:** User sessions must have configurable timeout periods (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity).
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-005:** The system shall use OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for UI client authentication against an identity provider.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-006:** Secure password reset mechanisms (e.g., email verification with time-limited tokens) must be implemented.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-007:** All authentication attempts (successful and failed) must be logged.

### 2.2 Service-to-Service Authentication
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-008:** Internal service-to-service communication (e.g., via gRPC) must be authenticated using mutual TLS (mTLS) certificates.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-009:** Services accessing other services via APIs exposed through the API Gateway must use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) obtained via a trusted identity provider or a secure token service.
    - JWTs must be signed using strong asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RSA RS256/RS512 or ECDSA ES256/ES512).
    - JWTs must have short expiry times and include necessary claims (e.g., `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, roles/permissions).

### 2.3 Agent Authentication
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-010:** Each agent instance must have a unique, verifiable identity within the system.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-011:** Agents authenticating to core services or MCP servers must use secure, short-lived credentials (e.g., JWTs, API keys) managed by HashiCorp Vault.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-012:** Credentials for agents must be dynamically provisioned and rotated regularly.

### 2.4 API Key Management
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-013:** For external third-party applications accessing the system's APIs, API keys must be supported.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-014:** API keys must be unique per client, securely generated, and allow for revocation.
- **REQ-SEC-AUTH-015:** The system must provide a mechanism for API key rotation (e.g., every 90 days as per `detailed_requirements.md` REQ-SEC-AUTH-015 which seems to be a typo and should be REQ-SEC-AUTH-015). This should be REQ-SEC-AUTH-015.

## 3. Authorization Requirements

- **REQ-SEC-AZ-001:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be implemented for all system functionalities and data access.
    - Roles (e.g., SystemAdmin, AgentDeveloper, TaskManagerUser, Viewer) with defined permission sets.
    - Users assigned to one or more roles.

- **REQ-SEC-AZ-003:** Authorization decisions must be enforced at the API Gateway and within individual services.
- **REQ-SEC-AZ-004:** Permissions must be granular, allowing control over actions (create, read, update, delete) on specific resources or resource types.
- **REQ-SEC-AZ-005:** A central policy decision point (PDP) or distributed policy enforcement points (PEPs) should be used for consistent authorization.
- **REQ-SEC-AZ-006:** All authorization failures (denied access attempts) must be logged for auditing and monitoring.
- **REQ-SEC-AZ-007:** Mechanisms for reviewing and managing user roles and permissions must be provided in the Admin UI.
